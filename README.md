# baseConverter

My first Go Application - very simple but has utility.

Accepts a decimal number as input and outputs the number in Binary, Octal and Hexidecimal.

Build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taran1sdev/baseConverter.git
go build baseConverter.go
```

Usage:
```bash
./baseConverter <integer>
```

Example:
```bash
$ ./baseConverter 946
Base Converter!

Decimal value: 946
--------------
Binary: 1110110010
Octal: 0o1662
Hex: 0x3B2
```
